<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>Hello there!</h2>
<p>Welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm Mario Nakhle, and I'm delighted to have you here. Let me take a moment to share a bit about myself.</p>

<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
<p>I am a freshly graduated Computer and Communications Engineer from Notre Dame University - Louaize, with a passion for development, both the growth and the practice. Whether I'm playing the piano, practicing code, or doing outdoor activities, you can always find me learning something new along the way.</p>

<h2>What I Do</h2>
<p>As of writing this About Me page, I am learning the various tools of web development, on my first step to becoming a fully fledged full-stack developer. It is a good way for me to add valuable skills to my CV, get more qualified for future positions ahead, and have fun doing so.</p>

<h2>My Interests</h2>
<p>Outside of work, I like both playing video games and music. You might catch me hiking, writing, or simply enjoying a good book at the comfort of my home and neighboring park.</p>

<h2>Why Am I Sharing This</h2>
<p>I decided to make this small website as a learning experience on HTML, and share it on GitHub. You might find more projects as the repositories begin piling up over time, and I'm hoping this will end up becoming a good portfolio once I have all the skills needed. I believe I might be able to pull it off, but I suppose you can be the judge of that.</p>

<h2>Let's Connect!</h2>
<p>I'm always excited to connect with like-minded individuals. Whether you're interested in collaborating, networking, simply learning with me, or just want to chat about anything, feel free to <a href="./contact.html">contact me.</a></p>

<p>Thank you for stopping by, and I look forward to sharing this journey with you!</p>

<p>Mario Nakhle</p>
